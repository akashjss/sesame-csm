# CSM

**2025/03/13** - We are releasing the 1B CSM variant. The checkpoint is [hosted on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/sesame/csm_1b).

---

CSM (Conversational Speech Model) is a speech generation model from [Sesame](https://www.sesame.com) that generates RVQ audio codes from text and audio inputs. The model architecture employs a [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) backbone and a smaller audio decoder that produces [Mimi](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi) audio codes.

A fine-tuned variant of CSM powers the [interactive voice demo](https://www.sesame.com/voicedemo) shown in our [blog post](https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice).

A hosted [HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sesame/csm-1b) is also available for testing audio generation.

## Requirements

* A CUDA-compatible GPU (runs on CPU otherwise)
* The code has been tested on CUDA 12.4 and 12.6, but it may also work on other versions
* Similarly, Python 3.10 is recommended, but newer versions may be fine
* For some audio operations, `ffmpeg` may be required
* Access to the following Hugging Face models:
  * [Llama-3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B)
  * [CSM-1B](https://huggingface.co/sesame/csm-1b)

### Setup

Clone and setup the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SesameAILabs/csm.git
cd csm
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Set environment variable to disable Triton compilation
export NO_TORCH_COMPILE=1

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install ffmpeg (required for audio processing):

```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install ffmpeg

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# On Windows
# Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

Download the required prompt audio files:

```bash
# Create prompts directory
mkdir -p prompts

# Download prompt files and place them in the prompts directory
https://huggingface.co/spaces/sesame/csm-1b/tree/main/prompts
```

### Quick Start

Run the model using the command line interface:

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable when running
NO_TORCH_COMPILE=1 python run_csm.py

# Option 2: Run normally (environment variable is set in the script)
python run_csm.py
```

The script will automatically use CUDA if available for faster generation,
otherwise it will fall back to CPU mode.

### Python API

Generate a single utterance:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
from generator import load_csm_1b
import torchaudio
import torch

# Use CUDA if available, otherwise CPU
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

model_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="sesame/csm-1b", filename="ckpt.pt")
generator = load_csm_1b(model_path, device)
audio = generator.generate(
    text="Hello from Sesame.",
    speaker=0,
    context=[],
    max_audio_length_ms=10_000,
)

torchaudio.save("audio.wav", audio.unsqueeze(0).cpu(), generator.sample_rate)
```

CSM sounds best when provided with context. You can prompt or provide context to the model using a `Segment` for each speaker's utterance.

```python
speakers = [0, 1, 0, 0]
transcripts = [
    "Hey how are you doing.",
    "Pretty good, pretty good.",
    "I'm great.",
    "So happy to be speaking to you.",
]
audio_paths = [
    "utterance_0.wav",
    "utterance_1.wav",
    "utterance_2.wav",
    "utterance_3.wav",
]

def load_audio(audio_path):
    audio_tensor, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(audio_path)
    audio_tensor = torchaudio.functional.resample(
        audio_tensor.squeeze(0), orig_freq=sample_rate, new_freq=generator.sample_rate
    )
    return audio_tensor

segments = [
    Segment(text=transcript, speaker=speaker, audio=load_audio(audio_path))
    for transcript, speaker, audio_path in zip(transcripts, speakers, audio_paths)
]
audio = generator.generate(
    text="Me too, this is some cool stuff huh?",
    speaker=1,
    context=segments,
    max_audio_length_ms=10_000,
)

torchaudio.save("audio.wav", audio.unsqueeze(0).cpu(), generator.sample_rate)
```

## FAQ

**Does this model come with any voices?**

The model open-sourced here is a base generation model. It is capable of producing a variety of voices, but it has not been fine-tuned on any specific voice.

**Can I converse with the model?**

CSM is trained to be an audio generation model and not a general-purpose multimodal LLM. It cannot generate text. We suggest using a separate LLM for text generation.

**Does it support other languages?**

The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training data, but it likely won't do well.

## Misuse and abuse ⚠️

This project provides a high-quality speech generation model for research and educational purposes. While we encourage responsible and ethical use, we **explicitly prohibit** the following:

- **Impersonation or Fraud**: Do not use this model to generate speech that mimics real individuals without their explicit consent.
- **Misinformation or Deception**: Do not use this model to create deceptive or misleading content, such as fake news or fraudulent calls.
- **Illegal or Harmful Activities**: Do not use this model for any illegal, harmful, or malicious purposes.

By using this model, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines. We are **not responsible** for any misuse, and we strongly condemn unethical applications of this technology.
